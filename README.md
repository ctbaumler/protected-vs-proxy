## Usage
Data can be downloaded via [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yousuf28/prosper-loan). 

`prosper.py` includes all code for adding the synthetic protected/proxy features to the Prosper data, training each model, generating the explanations, and calculating dataset statistics (e.g., correlation between features). Please be sure to change the path to the Prosper dataset as needed.
